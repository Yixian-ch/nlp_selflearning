The two first lines are also the border of each class. How the border is defined? Visualy, it's kind evident, but why we know it's a border?? two kinds of margin: hard and soft\n",
    "- Sometimes, data points are not separable in the current dimension, so we can transform our data in higher dimension to find the separable border(why not lower?). And this transformation can be expensive, so we have different ways to do this transformation, which are also called kernels. For example: `polynominal kernel`, `radial basis function rbf`, `sigmoid kernel`."
